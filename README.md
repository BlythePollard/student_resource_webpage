Student Resource Webpage

In this V1 of the Student Resource Webpage, students are able to create an account and log in to their portal. From their portal, they can access links relevant to their program as well as create goals for themselves. These goals include the date created, goal date of completion, detailed content, and a success status. Students can view, modify, and update their goals, and when they complete a goal they can mark its status as completed, at which point they get a congratulations message. Students are also able to delete goals. The Student Resource Webpage is designed to provide students with a clear and easily-accessible platform from which they can access all helpful resources as well as plan and track their short-term and long-term goals as they work through their self-paced program.
